This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb).
I will be using Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources/formats, assess its quality/tidyness and then clean it which it is called : Data Wrangling .The dataset that will be wrangled (and analyzing) is the tweet archive of
Twitter user @dog_Rates (WeRateDogs).This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

then by various visual and programtic assessments were performed to determine quality and tidiness issues using various techniques in pandas.
at the end do the visulaization about the finding .
